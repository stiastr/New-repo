Creating a readme
After finishing the project and making our repository public, we should think of a good readme file. This is visible on the main page of our repository and should offer good insight into our project to a person seeing it for the first time. We can post information such as:

What our project is about.
Installing and running our application.
When the last changes were made to our projects.
Short documentation on our project.
Any bugs or planned new functionalities.
Which license is used for our project.

We can use the Markdown language to make our readme files look better. You can find more information about this in the materials in the READ and WATCH sections.

Letâ€™s create the following readme file and push it to our main branch:

# First header
Main information about app

## Second header
App HTML details

```html
<p> Text paragraph</p>
```

## Third header
App JS details

```javascript
console.log("Hello world");
```
